Credit card fraud poses a significant financial and security challenge worldwide, resulting in billions of dollars in losses annually. This project aims to address this critical issue by developing a machine learning-based model to detect fraudulent transactions effectively. The model leverages historical credit card transaction data to identify patterns indicative of fraud. By employing a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGB Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, the project evaluates the performance of each approach in accurately distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
The primary objective is to enable early detection of fraudulent activities, ensuring that customersâ€™ money is safeguarded and unauthorized charges are prevented. This will positively impact customers by ensuring their funds are recovered and their accounts remain secure. The machine learning models will be trained and tested on a credit card transaction dataset, and their effectiveness will be evaluated based on metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and confusion matrix. This project not only demonstrates the applicability of machine learning in fraud detection but also highlights the importance of advanced algorithms in mitigating financial losses and enhancing the security of digital transactions.
